<h1>Loruki Website</h1>

<h3>This was a project that completely focused on the form submitting part of the website. In this Web site i used Netlify as my backend and hosting service. The user can submit his/her username details and other queries in the form box and those can be viewed by the administrator on the netlify console.</h3>



<h2>A beautiful UI was given to the user and some subtle animations were also added in the website to increase the interactivity.</h2>
